# Hello
This is a simple project made by me with simple code with the intent of dowloading a entire youtube playlist.

## What will you need
First of all so this code is able to work you will need to have downloaded ffmpeg and youtube-dlp.
Now on the Youtube API side you will need an youtube API key so this will be able to work.
You can find many sources on how to setup them and download them.

## How this code works
It is simply get the playlist link and parse through all videos playlist and run a command so it downloads them
